**Background:**

There were more than 20,000 deaths and over 119,000 recorded cases of MRSA infection in 2017,
according to recent data published by the CDC. Even more worrisome is new data supporting that silent
carriers of MRSA have twice the mortality rate of individuals without the deadly bacteria. Drugs that
previously worked to eradicate MRSA are becoming less effective because the bacteria is adapting and
becoming more resistant to methicillin and similar treatments (CDC 2019).
However, many researchers have found potential candidates of fungi that have proven to have some
antimicrobial activity against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. For example, Qaio found that
Aspermerodione of the phylum ascomycota worked as an inhibitor of penicillin-binding protein 2a, which
in turn inhibited MRSA (Qaio et al. 2018). Researcher Luo also discovered that the nanofibers from deep
marine fungus Fusarium also showed antimicrobial activity against MRSA (Luo et al. 2018). These
researchers, along with many others, have proven that fungi have properties that would allow for the
discovery of MRSA-susceptible antibiotics.
Although other researchers have proven fungal Anti-MRSA activity, our research differs in the sense that
we will be bioprospecting for our fungi in high trafficked areas in the Utah Valley. Such areas include the
Vineyard Sewage Treatment Facility, The UVU wrestling room, and sediment from the Provo River, etc.

**Methods:**

To begin this experiment, we will need to collect various samples in order to obtain many different types
of fungus. Our plan is to go to ten sites and at each site we will choose two locations to collect samples
at. We will then collect two replicants at each of the locations we choose. Some specific locations we
will be sampling at include: the Vineyard Sewage Treatment Facility, The UVU wrestling room,
sediment from the Provo River, etc (Sample Size:ï¿½ ). To collect our samples we will use sterile 40
cotton swabs placed into test tubes. Once we finish collecting samples, we will bring them back to the
lab to grow and culture them on cornmeal agar plates(CMA). After we see growth in our plates, we will
isolate our different fungi by removing the different fungi that have grown on the plate. We know it is a
different species of fungi depending on the growth, color and texture, as we will be using strict eye tests
to separate these different fungi species. Once the different species of fungi have been identified, we will
separate them through the use of a scalpel, new test tubes, and new sterile plates. The fungi removed will
then be placed in different labeled petri dishes and we will continue to culture them. After growing the
fungi we will introduce them to MRSA. We will accomplish this by spreading MRSA onto a dish and
then using antibiotic assay disks covered in fungi to identify any potential MRSA inhibiting fungi. Any
found MRSA resistant fungi will then be sequenced and identified using Sanger Sequencing.
